                <h2>HOW WHY WHAT</h2>
                <p>I've always had a love for the arts. Fashion, food, music, art you name it. I love people, beautifull
                    people and observing them. I studied fashion had to comumute to uni everyday. I sat in the train for
                    more than and hour and observed people, the zeitgeist and scrolled on my phone for ages to feed my
                    fuel
                    for beautiful things. I decided to bring it all together in one blog, one website and cummilate my
                    thoughts and obsession I found out abt while on the metro. That is how Metro Style Labe started
                    three
                    years ago and we've just kept growing and made it something more than just me. Metro Style Lab is
                    your
                    one stop shop to today's zeitgeist. We hope to inspire you and teach you some stuff a long the way.

                    Happy reading lovelies

                    Love,
